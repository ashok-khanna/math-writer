   <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Thank you for visiting this page (Math Writer). Math Writer is a rich text web editor for mathematics, utilising the powerful <a href="https://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a> library for rendering math and the <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud">TinyMCE</a> library for a powerful, bug-free rich text experience. It is aimed at desktop users (not mobile) who want to generate HTML or pdfs of well formatted rich text and mathematics. Apart from its GUI interface, Math Writer supports Markdown for text entry, AsciiMath and LaTex for math entry. You can enter common mathematical symbols with keyboard shortcuts (refer shortcuts tab).</p>

    <h3>The Basics</h3>
    <p>Math Writer has four navigational tabs: Editor, Preview, Shortcuts and Read Me. You can navigate between these tabs through <mark-grey>Ctrl + Shift 1</mark-grey>, <mark-grey>Ctrl + Shift + 2</mark-grey>, <mark-grey>Ctrl + Shift + 3</mark-grey> and <mark-grey>Ctrl + Shift + 4</mark-grey> keyboard shortcuts respectively. 

    <table class="table-tutorial">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Tab</th>
          <th>Guide</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><mark onclick="editor()">Editor</mark></td>
          <td><p>The rich text editor is contained within the editor tab. You can enter can text, tables, lists, and of course, mathematical input (refer notes below). The editor allows you to format non-mathematical content through the various buttons for bold, italics, underline, color changes, text styles and so on. You can also use Markdown.</p>
          <p>Math input on the other hand is not rendered in the editor tab - rather, you will see the raw code here, allowing you to modify it quickly. The preview tab renders mathematical content.</p>
          <p>There are four very useful buttons in the editor toolbar:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><mark-grey>Char Map</mark-grey> (top left of the editor toolbar): Toggles the visibility of a set of comonly used symbols that you can insert into your file</li>
            <li><mark-grey>Import Content</mark-grey> (right end of the editor toolbar): Import html or text files stored on your computer into the editor (overriding anything that may currently be entered in the editor)</li>
            <li><mark-grey>Export Content</mark-grey> (right end of the editor toolbar): Export the raw HTML markup of the content you have entered (e.g. to save your work or to publish into your personal website). Refer notes below if you want to re-use this content in your personal webpages</li>
            <li><mark-grey>&lt;&gt;</mark-grey> (top right of the editor toolbar): Quickly see the raw HTML markup of your file, useful for finely editing the raw HTML markup in a way that is not possible when editing in the default formatted view. Hopefully you do not need to this ever, but the option is there</li>
          </ul>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><mark onclick="preview()">Preview</mark></td>
          <td>The preview tab will render your math and display the final output. If you print this page to pdf (via your browser), this output will be exported to pdf.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><mark onclick="shortcuts()">Shortcuts</mark></td>
          <td>The shortcuts tab contains a list of keyboard shortcuts supported by this app to enter mathematical symbols. You can modify these shortcuts by downloading a local copy of the repo and modifying the shortcuts in writer.js (modify the TinyMCE configuration variable).</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Using Markdown</h3>
    <p>The rich text editor supports either formatting non-math input through the various GUI buttons in the editor's toolbar or through Markdown commands. Headers can be added via Markdown by starting a newline with #, ##, ... ###### (6 levels of heading with # representing H1). Italics can be entered by enclosing text with an asterisk *, whilst bold can be entered by enclosing text with a double asterisk **. You can start lists any of the following characters (the enclosing quotations are not to be included), each providing an alternate type of list (bullet, numerical, alphabetical, roman): "*", "-", "1.", "1)", "a.", "a)", "i." and "i)".</p>

    <h3>How to Enter Math</h3>
    <p>The editor supports both <a href="http://asciimath.org">AsciiMath</a> or <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">LaTex</a> input. Math can be entered in the editor either inline within a sentence of text, or by itself as a block of math. I prefer AsciiMath for inline math as it is easier to read, and LaTex for blocks as it has better equation alignment (but it is ultimately your preference). Below are illustrative examples.</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Input Method</th>
          <th>Delimiter</th>
          <th>Input Example</th>
          <th>Output</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Inline AsciiMath (recommended)</td>
          <td>Backticks <w>`</w> ... <w>`</w></td>
          <td><w>`</w>alpha ∩ beta = 3<w>`</w></td>
          <td>`alpha ∩ beta = 3`</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Inline LaTex (not recommended)</td>
          <td>Backslash then parentheses <w>\(</w> ... <w>\)</w></td>
          <td><w>\(</w>\alpha \cap \beta = 3<w>\)</w></td>
          <td>\(\alpha \cap \beta = 3\)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Block AsciiMath without alignment (not recommended)</td>
          <td>Backticks <w>`</w> ... <w>`</w></td>
          <td><w>`</w>f(x) = x + 3 - 2<w>`</w><br /><w>`</w>= x + 1<w>`</w><br /><w>`</w>f'(x) = 1<w>`</w></td>
          <td>`f(x) = x + 3 - 2`<br />`= x + 1`<br />`f'(x) = 1`</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Block AsciiMath with alignment through matrices (not recommended)</td>
          <td>Backticks <w>`</w> ... <w>`</w></td>
          <td><w>`</w>{:(f(x)  ,=, x + 3 - 2),(      ,=, x + 1 ),(f'(x) ,=, 1 ):}<w>`</w></td>
          <td>`{:(f(x)  ,=, x + 3 - 2),(      ,=, x + 1 ),(f'(x) ,=, 1 ):}`</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Block LaTex (recommended)</td>
          <td>Backslash then square brackets <w>\[</w> ... <w>\]</w> or double dollar signs <w>$$</w> ... <w>$$</w></td>
          <td><w>\[\begin{aligned}</w>f(x) <w>&</w>= x + 3 - 2 <w>\\</w> <w>&</w>= x + 1<w><w>\end{aligned}</w>\]</w> <w>$$</w>f'(x) = 1<w>$$</w></td>
          <td>\[\begin{aligned}f(x) &= x + 3 - 2 \\ &= x + 1\end{aligned}\] $$f'(x) = 1$$</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Note that the last two examples for block AsciiMath and LaTex input appear convoluted. I suggest avoiding AsciiMath block input as it requires you to correctly place each part of the equation into a matrix: the {: ... :} are to start a matrix, the () are for each row and the , is used to split each row into its cells. On the other hand, whilst the block latex input looks complicated, that is mostly because I squashed it all onto one line (to illustrate that line breaks are ignored). It only has a few basic rules and is a straightforward method to input multi-line equations:</p>
    <uL><li>Equations must begin with <w>\begin{aligned}</w> and end with <w>\end{aligned}</w></li>
      <li><w>&=</w> is used for aligning the equations </li>
      <li><w>\\</w> is used to break to a new line</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Printing to Pdf</h3>
    <p>To print your content to pdf, first navigate to the Preview tab to render your Math. Once your Math is rendered, you can simply print to pdf using your browser's print functionality. Note that in your browser's print options, you can select to hide the header and footer that is automatically added by your browser to the print selection.</p>

    <h3>Exporting Math to the Web</h3>
    <p>You can export the raw HTML markup behind your content via a button in the editor. To subsequently include this on your website or blog, you will need to load the MathJax JavaScript library as well. Add the following code to your website:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;script>
window.MathJax = {
    loader: { load: ['[tex]/ams'] },
    tex: { packages: {'[+]': ['ams']} },
    "fast-preview": { disabled: true },
    extensions: ["tex2jax.js", "asciimath2jax.js", "TeX/AMSmath.js", "TeX/AMSsymbols.js", "TeX/noErrors.js"],
    jax: ["input/TeX", "input/AsciiMath", "output/HTML-CSS"],
    displayAlign: "left",
    tex2jax: {
      inlineMath: [ ["\\(","\\)"] ],
      displayMath: [ ['$$','$$'], ["\\[","\\]"] ],
      processEscapes: true
    }, 
    asciimath2jax: { delimiters: [['`','`']], preview: [""]},
    "HTML-CSS": { fonts: ["STIX"] }
  }
&lt;/script>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" async src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.7/MathJax.js">&lt;/script>
      </code></pre>
